/-- The lifting of `sys.step` from `State → Label → PMF State → Prop` to a
relation on initial and final distributions, parameterised by a label, *closed
under convex combinations* of valid system steps.

`hyperStep sys μ_pre l μ_post` holds iff there is an assignment
`p : State → PMF (PMF State)` choosing, for every starting state, a
randomised mixture of successor-distributions, such that

* every `s ∈ μ_pre.support` and every `μ ∈ (p s).support` takes a valid step
  `sys.step s l μ`;
* `μ_post` is the resulting bind:
  `μ_post = μ_pre.bind (fun s => (p s).bind id)`.

Allowing `p s` to be a `PMF (PMF State)` (rather than a single `PMF State`)
makes the relation closed under convex combinations of hyper-steps. In the
singleton case `μ_pre = PMF.pure s` it reduces to: `μ_post` is in the convex
hull of `{μ | sys.step s l μ}`. Every state in `μ_pre.support` must
contribute a real step — there is no stutter freedom for internal labels. -/
