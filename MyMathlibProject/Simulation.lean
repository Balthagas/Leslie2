# Probabilistic forward simulation and weak transitions

A probabilistic forward simulation between two PLTS over a common label
alphabet is a state relation `R` such that initial concrete states are
matched by initial abstract states with which they are `R`-related, and every
concrete transition can be matched by an abstract transition whose resulting
distribution is related to the concrete one in the sense of a *coupling*: a
joint distribution with the appropriate marginals whose support lies in `R`.

This file:
* defines `PMFRel R` — the lifting of a state relation `R : α → β → Prop` to a
  relation on `PMF α × PMF β` via the existence of a joint PMF;
* defines `StrongProbabilisticSimulation sys_C sys_A R` — the strong
  probabilistic forward simulation from `sys_C` to `sys_A`;
* defines `LabelledSystem State Label` — a system enriched with an
  `internal : Label → Prop` predicate partitioning labels into internal
  (silent) and external (observable);
* defines `WeakScheduler sys` — a path-dependent scheduler that may stop, only
  schedules internal labels, and is bounded so that any prefix of length at
  least `runtime` is forced to stop;
* defines `weakTau` — the weak (internal) transition relation `μ_init ⇒^τ μ`
  on initial distributions, obtained by binding a `WeakScheduler`'s run;
* defines `hyperStep` — the convex-closed lifting of `sys.step` to a
  hyper-transition `μ_pre -[l]→ μ_post` on distributions;
* defines `weakStep` — the weak external step `μ_init ⇒^l μ_final`, composing
  τ-closure, hyper-step, τ-closure;
* defines `WeakProbabilisticSimulation sys_C sys_A R` — the weak probabilistic
  forward simulation, where each concrete transition is matched by `weakTau`
  or `weakStep` on the abstract side, according to whether its label is
  internal in `sys_C`;
* defines `ProbabilisticForwardSimulation sys_C sys_A R` — a variant of
  `WeakProbabilisticSimulation` whose relation `R : State_C → PMF State_A →
  Prop` links each concrete state to a *distribution* over abstract states;
  equivalent modulo typing;
* defines `Stream'.Seq.filter` — a generic noncomputable filter on
  possibly-infinite sequences;
* defines `LabelledSystem.trace` — the (possibly infinite) sequence of
  external labels appearing in an execution;
* defines `LabelledSystem.traceProb` — the probability that a probabilistic
  execution produces a given trace, as the sum of execution probabilities
  over all finite executions whose trace equals the target.

and external (observable) labels: `ls.internal l` says that `l` is internal,
and external labels are exactly the labels `l` with `¬ ls.internal l`. -/

/-- A weak scheduler for a labelled system. It may stop (`none` in its output
PMF), only schedules internal labels (`internal_only`), only proposes valid

least `runtime` (`stops`). -/

end WeakScheduler

/-- Weak (internal) transition `μ_init ⇒^τ μ` on initial distributions: there
exists a weak scheduler whose run, sampled over starting states from `μ_init`,
produces the distribution `μ`. The "from a single state" case is recovered as
`weakTau sys (PMF.pure s) μ`. -/
def weakTau (sys : LabelledSystem State Label)
    (μ_init : PMF State) (μ : PMF State) : Prop :=
  ∃ σ : WeakScheduler sys, μ_init.bind σ.run = μ

/-- The lifting of `sys.step` from `State → Label → PMF State → Prop` to a
relation on initial and final distributions, parameterised by a label, *closed
under convex combinations* of valid system steps.

`hyperStep sys μ_pre l μ_post` holds iff there is an assignment
`p : State → PMF (PMF State)` choosing, for every starting state, a
randomised mixture of valid successor distributions, such that

* every starting state `s ∈ μ_pre.support` has every distribution `μ` in the
  support of `p s` satisfying `sys.step s l μ`, and
* `μ_post` is the resulting bind:
  `μ_post = μ_pre.bind (fun s => (p s).bind id)`.

This is the natural lifting of a strong system step to *hyper-transitions* on
distributions. Allowing `p s` to be a `PMF (PMF State)` (rather than a single
`PMF State`) makes the relation closed under convex combinations of hyper-steps:
given two witnesses `p₁, p₂` producing `μ_post₁, μ_post₂`, any
`α • μ_post₁ + (1-α) • μ_post₂` is witnessed by `α • p₁ s + (1-α) • p₂ s` at
each state, using linearity of `PMF.bind`. In the singleton case
`μ_pre = PMF.pure s` it reduces to: `μ_post` is in the convex hull of
`{μ | sys.step s l μ}`. -/
def hyperStep (sys : System State Label)
    (μ_pre : PMF State) (l : Label) (μ_post : PMF State) : Prop :=
  ∃ p : State → PMF (PMF State),
    (∀ s ∈ μ_pre.support, ∀ μ ∈ (p s).support, sys.step s l μ) ∧
    μ_post = μ_pre.bind (fun s => (p s).bind id)

/-- The weak external step `μ_init ⇒^l μ_final`, composing the three layers
`τ-closure → hyper-step with label l → τ-closure`. Concretely there exist
intermediate distributions `μ, μ'` with

* `μ_init ⇒^τ μ` (a `weakTau`),
* `μ -[l]→ μ'` (a `hyperStep` with label `l`),
* `μ' ⇒^τ μ_final` (another `weakTau`).

Defined uniformly for any label `l`. For external (non-`internal`) labels this
is the standard weak step; for internal labels it is one strictly forced
internal hyper-step sandwiched between two τ-closures (which is *not* the same
as `weakTau` — for τ-labels, prefer `weakTau` directly). -/
def weakStep (sys : LabelledSystem State Label)
    (μ_init : PMF State) (l : Label) (μ_final : PMF State) : Prop :=
  ∃ μ μ' : PMF State,
    weakTau sys μ_init μ ∧
    hyperStep sys.toSystem μ l μ' ∧
    weakTau sys μ' μ_final

/-- A *weak* probabilistic forward simulation from `sys_C` to `sys_A` along the
state relation `R : State_C → State_A → Prop`. Both systems carry an
internal/external label partition.

* `init`: every initial concrete state is matched by some initial abstract
  state with which it is `R`-related;
* `step`: every concrete transition `s_C -[l]→ μ_C` from an `R`-related pair
  `(s_C, s_A)` is matched on the abstract side by:
  - a `weakTau` (a τ-closure from `PMF.pure s_A`) when `l` is *internal* in
    `sys_C` — the concrete invisible step is matched by zero-or-more invisible
    abstract steps;
  - a `weakStep` with the same label `l` from `PMF.pure s_A` when `l` is
    *external* in `sys_C` — the concrete visible step is matched by
    τ-closure + one strong `l`-step + τ-closure on the abstract side;

  in both cases the resulting abstract distribution `μ_A` must be related to
  `μ_C` by `PMFRel R`. -/

      PMFRel R μ_C μ_A

/-- A *probabilistic* forward simulation from `sys_C` to `sys_A`, parameterised
by a relation `R : State_C → PMF State_A → Prop` linking each concrete state to
a *distribution* over abstract states (rather than to a single abstract state
as in `WeakProbabilisticSimulation`).

* `init`: every initial concrete state is matched by some abstract distribution
  supported on initial abstract states;
* `step`: from an `R`-related pair `(s_C, μ_A)` with `μ_A : PMF State_A`, every
  concrete transition `s_C -[l]→ μ_C` is matched on the abstract side by a
  weak transition from `μ_A` to `ω.bind id`, where `ω : PMF (PMF State_A)` is
  a coupling of `μ_C` with `R`-related abstract distributions (i.e.
  `PMFRel R μ_C ω`). The choice between `weakTau` and `weakStep` depends, as
  in `WeakProbabilisticSimulation`, on whether `l` is internal in `sys_C`.

Modulo the typing of `R` (`State_C → PMF State_A → Prop` here vs.
`State_C → State_A → Prop` there), the matching pattern is exactly the same as
in `WeakProbabilisticSimulation`: `PMFRel R` couples the concrete outcome with
the abstract outcome, and the case split on `sys_C.internal l` picks between
the τ-only and the external weak transition. The notion is equivalent to
`WeakProbabilisticSimulation` (the latter is the special case where each `μ_A`
is concentrated on a single abstract state). -/

/-! ### Traces -/

/-- The trace of a (possibly infinite) execution `e` under a labelled system
`ls`: the sequence of external labels appearing in `e.trans`, in order, with
internal (τ) labels dropped. Finite if `e` has finitely many external
transitions, infinite otherwise. -/
noncomputable def LabelledSystem.trace (ls : LabelledSystem State Label)
    (e : AlterSeq State Label) : Seq Label :=
  (e.trans.filter (fun p => ¬ ls.internal p.1)).map Prod.fst

/-- The probability that the probabilistic execution `pe` produces a finite
execution whose trace under `ls` equals `τ`: the (countable) sum of
`pe.probOf` over all finite executions `e` with `ls.trace e = τ`.

For finite `τ` this is the standard trace probability. For infinite `τ` the
sum is `0` since no finite execution can produce an infinite trace; capturing
infinite-trace probabilities would require moving to a measure-theoretic
setting on the σ-algebra generated by trace cones. -/

    (pe : ProbabilisticExecution ls.toSystem) (τ : Seq Label) : ENNReal :=

/-! ### Segala's trace inclusion theorem -/

/-- **Segala's main theorem (trace inclusion)**: if `R` is a probabilistic
forward simulation from `sys_C` to `sys_A`, then every concrete probabilistic
execution `pe_C` starting from initial states of `sys_C` is matched, trace by
trace, by some abstract probabilistic execution `pe_A` over `sys_A`.

Informally: the simulation suffices to transport the entire trace distribution
of any concrete adversary to a matching abstract adversary.

Proof sketch (not yet formalised):
* lift `sim.init` to build `pe_A.init` as a bind of the `R`-related abstract
  distributions over `pe_C.init.support`;
* construct `pe_A.scheduler` step-by-step from `pe_C.scheduler` using
  `sim.step` at each prefix. The finite-scheduler restriction on `weakTau` is
  what makes the inductive construction effective: each abstract weak-step
  witness has a bounded `runtime`, so each step adds finitely many abstract
  transitions and the recursion is well-founded;
* the trace-equality conclusion then follows by tracking the
  `PMFRel`-coupling at every step and using the fact that internal
  transitions don't affect `LabelledSystem.trace`.

Compared to Segala's original statement, ours is restricted to finite-runtime
schedulers on the abstract side (our `weakTau` is finite-bounded, whereas
Segala admits AS-terminating ones). The conclusion is consequently stated on
finite-trace `traceProb`; the infinite-trace measure-theoretic version awaits
a later upgrade to `MeasureTheory.Measure`. -/
